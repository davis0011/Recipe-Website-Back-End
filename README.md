# Recipe Website Back-End
This repository contains the backend code for a collaborative recipe website developed by me and my partner, Noam.

## Technologies Used
- Node.js: The backend is built using Node.js, providing a scalable and efficient runtime environment.

- Express: Utilized the Express framework for building robust and flexible APIs to handle HTTP requests and responses.

- MySQL Database: Integrated a MySQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval, supporting the recipe and user data.

- Spoonacular API: Incorporated the Spoonacular API to fetch recipes and related information, enhancing the variety and richness of the recipe content.

- University Cloud Server: The backend is deployed on the university-provided cloud server, ensuring accessibility and reliability for users.

## Introduction
The Recipe Website Back-End serves as the server-side component for our full-stack recipe website. Developed using Node.js with Express and SQL, this backend interacts with the Spoonacular API to fetch recipes and related information. The website is currently deployed on the university-provided cloud server and is accessible at https://dn-recipes.cs.bgu.ac.il/#/.

Our goal is to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable experience in exploring, sharing, and discovering diverse recipes. The backend handles user authentication, stores recipe and user profile data, and communicates with the front-end to deliver a cohesive user interface.
